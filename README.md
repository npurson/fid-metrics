# FID/FVD Metrics

This repository provides a toolkit for computing Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and Fréchet Video Distance (FVD) metrics, widely utilized for assessing the quality of generative models in the fields of image and video generation.

## Installation

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

In the absence of setting up the package, users can currently utilize it by the following as a temporal fix.

0. **Setup**

    ```shell
    export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH
    ```

1. **Calculating FID/FVD**

    ```shell
    python fid_metrics/main.py paths=[path1,path2]
    ```

    `path1`, `path2` can either be images, videos, folders of images or pathnames of the aforementioned that match the pattern of `glob`.
