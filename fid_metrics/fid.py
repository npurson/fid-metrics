"""Calculates the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) to evalulate GANs

The FID metric calculates the distance between two distributions of images.
Typically, we have summary statistics (mean & covariance matrix) of one
of these distributions, while the 2nd distribution is given by a GAN.

When run as a stand-alone program, it compares the distribution of
images that are stored as PNG/JPEG at a specified location with a
distribution given by summary statistics (in pickle format).

The FID is calculated by assuming that X_1 and X_2 are the activations of
the pool_3 layer of the inception net for generated samples and real world
samples respectively.

See --help to see further details.
